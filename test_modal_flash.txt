Test Scenario:
1. Parent Modal A: Position (10,5), Size (80x25), ZIndex assigned when added
2. Child Modal B: Position (20,10), Size (60x15), ZIndex assigned when added

When clicking at position (30, 15):
- Both modals overlap at this point
- GetWindowAtPoint filters: both pass bounds check
- OrderBy ZIndex: [ModalA(zindex=1), ModalB(zindex=2)]
- LastOrDefault returns: ModalB (zindex=2) <- CORRECT

When clicking at position (12, 7):
- Only Modal A is at this point (Child B starts at 20,10)
- GetWindowAtPoint filters: only ModalA passes bounds check  
- Returns: ModalA
- SetActiveWindow(ModalA) called
- IsActivationBlocked(ModalA) returns TRUE (has child modal B)
- GetBlockingModal(ModalA) returns ModalB
- FlashWindow(ModalB) called <- FLASH!

The issue is NOT with GetWindowAtPoint returning the wrong window.
The issue is that clicking ANYWHERE on the parent modal (even areas not covered by child)
triggers the flash because the parent is blocked by its child.

Expected behavior: Clicking on uncovered areas of parent should activate child
Actual behavior: It does, but with a flash

But wait - re-reading the bug report: "clicking on the child modal causes the parent modal to flash"

Let me trace through clicking directly on child modal B:
Position (30, 15) - on child modal B
- GetWindowAtPoint returns ModalB 
- SetActiveWindow(ModalB)
- IsActivationBlocked(ModalB) - should return FALSE (child is not blocked)
- ModalB should be activated without flash

So why would there be a flash? Unless...
